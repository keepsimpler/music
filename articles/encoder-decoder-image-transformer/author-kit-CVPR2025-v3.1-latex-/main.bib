  abstractNote={We introduce a challenging set of 256 object categories containing a total of 30607 images. The original Caltech-101 was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions.},

    abstract = "In the Transformer model, {``}self-attention{''} combines information from attended embeddings into the representation of the focal embedding in the next layer. Thus, across layers of the Transformer, information originating from different tokens gets increasingly mixed. This makes attention weights unreliable as explanations probes. In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying this flow of information through self-attention. We propose two methods for approximating the attention to input tokens given attention weights, attention rollout and attention flow, as post hoc methods when we use attention weights as the relative relevance of the input tokens. We show that these methods give complementary views on the flow of information, and compared to raw attention, both yield higher correlations with importance scores of input tokens obtained using an ablation method and input gradients.",

abstract = { To interpret Vision Transformers, post-hoc explanations assign salience scores to input pixels, providing human-understandable heatmaps. However, whether these inter-pretations reflect true rationales behind the model's output is still underexplored. To address this gap, we study the faithfulness criterion of explanations: the assigned salience scores should represent the influence of the corresponding input pixels on the model's predictions. To evaluate faithful-ness, we introduce Salience-guided Faithfulness Coefficient (SaCo), a novel evaluation metric leveraging essential in-formation of salience distribution. Specifically, we con-duct pair-wise comparisons among distinct pixel groups and then aggregate the differences in their salience scores, resulting in a coefficient that indicates the explanation's degree of faithfulness. Our explorations reveal that cur-rent metrics struggle to differentiate between advanced ex-planation methods and Random Attribution, thereby failing to capture the faithfulness property. In contrast, our pro-posed SaCo offers a reliable faithfulness measurement, es-tablishing a robust metric for interpretations. Furthermore, our SaCo demonstrates that the use of gradient and multi-layer aggregation can markedly enhance the faithfulness of attention-based explanation, shedding light on potential paths for advancing Vision Transformer explainability. },
